            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E all complaite of our present miseries by the bloody distractions of the Kingdome, by this unnaturall war; But few of us consider-seriously of the cause whence these distractions come.</p>
            <p>For information herein, take notice that sinne is the only cause of every affliction, and of all punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whether to private men, or whole Kingdomes. We by our sins have provoked God to anger, and God sheweth his anger by his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon us. King and Subject have sinned, and now King and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject are punished. God causeth us to punish one another; hee doth it either to reforme us, or to destroy us.</p>
            <p>But God is the efficient cause of all, the cause of all causes: all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther causes are but Gods instruments. Now the instrumentall cause of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur distractions, is wicked men. God useth one sinner to punish ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Israels</hi> sins were punished by wicked <hi>Shishacke,</hi> and by Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous <hi>Ashur,</hi> whom God calleth the rod of his anger, and the staffe in his hand. So God punished <hi>Davids</hi> finne by wicked <hi>Absolom,</hi> and King <hi>Rehoboams</hi> sinne by his rebellious people, and the sinnes of the people by their King <hi>Iereboam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet be informed, that though God doe use wicked men for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments; wicked men do wickedly even in the things in which God useth them to doe his will, for they are naturally the Devills instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to execute his will, and their owne devillish malice; as wee see in <hi>Iob.</hi> That which God doth by wicked men is just, but that which wicked men doe is unjust: for they have no eye to the doing of Gods will, but to their owne wicked end, which is alwaies unjust and sinfull. For example, It was just with God to punish <hi>Davids</hi> bloud-guiltinesse &amp; Adultery by <hi>Absoloms</hi> rebellion, and defiling of <hi>Davids</hi> Concubines:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:125873:3"/> But it was unjust and wicked in <hi>Absolom</hi> to doe it: it was just with God to punish <hi>Rehoboam</hi> by the revolt of his people, but injust in them to cast him off from being their King.</p>
            <p>So it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>st with God to punish us at this day by these distractions, and unnaturall Warres, and to suffer the King to be misled by a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Councell, to afflict and spoyle his people: but it is unjust in that Councell, and error in the King to be led by them to doe such things.</p>
            <p>For their aime is wicked and devillish, and are naturally the devills instruments to make warre against Christ: their end is to destroy the true Protestant Religion, to subvert our good Lawes, and to establish Popery, and bring us and our posterities, our bodies and soules into spirituall and slavish bondage for ever: and to root out Protestant Religion from all places in Christendome.</p>
            <p>This is a certaine truth, and will clearely appeare to any rationall man that will but take a view of their forepast proceedings, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent warre, and the persons contriving, and acting it.</p>
            <p>First, take a view of their fore-past proceedings, and consider (not to look so farre, as to the Raigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or King <hi>Iames,</hi> both of blessed memory) in whose times that Jesuiticall faction were active in Treasons, by poyson, stabbing, blowing up Parliaments, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying posterities of Kings, Nobles, and massacring whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>Onely note their proceedings in the passages of things since the first of His Majesties Raigne, at which time we may remember, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was the great favorite: who (by confederacy which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites and Priests, first in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>France,</hi> when his Majesty married with the <hi>French</hi> Kings Sister) gave great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Popish partie in all places, and furthered their designes in <hi>England</hi> by uncontrolled power: for through the favour and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Duke had from the King, he ruled, and swayed the course of things in the Kingdome: and it was evident by those times, that the Jesuites swayed him, and by his greatnesse brought many of their own faction, into the greatest places of command, whom they desired, he put in, and whom they disliked, he put out: that most at the Councell-Table were their friends, or such as durst not oppose them.</p>
            <p>And to make way for their disigne upon <hi>England,</hi> they set upon the Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> to weaken them, and to that end His Majesties ships were lent against <hi>Rochell,</hi> which destroyed their shipping, and blocked up the passage: and when the Duke was questioned in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125873:3"/> the answer was, the shippes were not lent with intention to hurt <hi>Rochell</hi> but in complement to the King of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then a Fleet was prepared, the Duke himselfe would goe with it, pretending to relieve <hi>Rochell:</hi> but when they came to Isle of <hi>Ree,</hi> all our brave Souldiers were betrayed to the sword, <hi>Rochell</hi> robbed of their provision, and the Protestants sold into their enemies hands.</p>
            <p>What other voyages were made (to <hi>Cadis</hi> and other places, wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member too) &amp; observed then that their end was nothing but to weaken the Kingdome, and prepare to the enfuing treason against our Religion, and Lawes.</p>
            <p>Then they began the worke of <hi>England,</hi> by crying up Arminianisme defending those tenents, patronizing their writings, printing and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing those dangerous bookes of <hi>Mountagues:</hi> which (before King <hi>Iames</hi> had seene, disallowed, condemned, and forbid to be printed) <hi>Mountague</hi> was made a Bishop, and Doctor <hi>White</hi> also, for defending those bookes at a pact conference: All ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers were presently preferred, that favored those tennts, as <hi>Cozens, Wren, Corbart, &amp;c.</hi> Thus they sowed the seedes of Popery thoughout the whole Kingdome, which shewed they expected to have a crop of pure Popery.</p>
            <p>To bring this forward, the power and professors of Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were disgraced and persecuted. I will onely give you a view of some particulars: and you may judge of the whole, as the Geometrician did at the body of <hi>Hercules</hi> by his foot.</p>
            <p>We can remember (it is so lately) that all our best Divines, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Orthodox professors of Religion, of the Laiety were by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty scoffed at, and persecuted in the High-Commission, and all other Courts of that nature, if it were but for going from a dumbe Arminian Reader out of his owne Parish to heare an Orthodox Preacher: All laborious Orthodox Preachers were pecked at, and by some soule mouthes almost devoured: I am sure very many suffered under the little <hi>Wren:</hi> for he peckt up all those precious plants out of his Diocesse.</p>
            <p>Then Lectures were put downe in all places, and afternoone Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons forbidden on the Lords day: Bookes were also published and commanded to bee read in all Churches, giving liberty to prophane that holy day, contrary to the expresse command of God, and against the enacted law of the Kingdome; all Ministers that refused to reade these bookes were suspended: Thus good men were weeded out in all Countreys and all to displant Religion, and plant popery.</p>
            <p>The Arminian Priests and Court Chapleins cryed out against the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:125873:4"/> Sanctifying of the Lords day, called <hi>Sunday no Sabboth,</hi> and denyed the morality of the fourth Commandement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And these men would not be called Preachers, nor Ministers (names that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gloried in) but called themselves Priests: the holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble might no longer be called Table, but Altar: and the standing of it was altered, and it made a reall Altar, ascended to by steps, with bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cringing, and reverence to it Crucifixes set up, Basons and Tapers were set upon it: nothing was wanting of Popery, but the name Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and the Idoll-Sacrifice of the Masse.</p>
            <p>Nor was that Idoll altogether wanting, for it was daily in <hi>Somerset-House,</hi> St. <hi>Iames-house,</hi> and divers other places; common to all that would goe to it: nor durst any man question those that went, though they were seene to goe every day.</p>
            <p>Priests frequented Papists houses in all Counties, and no man might question them; if any by lawfull authority did apprehend a Priest, they were checked for it, and the Priest discharged by speciall command from the Queene, or under some Privie Councellors hands.</p>
            <p>Court Chaplaines and Bishops preached Iustification by workes, Free-will, seven Sacraments, and Consubstantiation: (a faire way to Transubstantiation) with a number of other popish Doctrines; and maintained, that there might easily be a conjunction betweene the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist and us: so it is plaine that wee must have gone wholly to them: for they professe they will not come one jot to us.</p>
            <p>The Presses were allowed to Arminians, and the Popish faction, to print any popish tenents, but forbid to the good Protestants: none might preach against their positions, much lesse print any thing for confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their errours or heresies, upon paine of imprisonment, fining, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension, pilloring, cutting off eares, slitting of noses, banishment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more cruelty then hath beene inflicted upon any Protestant among the Turks: when these and more have beene questioned in Parliament, our Parliaments were broken, the evils increased.</p>
            <p>Yea, Parliament men were disgraced and imprisoned: and because Parliame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The the little (great) Bishop (like a Pope) sent his commands by his Legats and Commissioners, that they should receive that Liturgy, but not obeyed: the honest <hi>Scots</hi> were proclaimed Rebells and Traitors, and an Army raised to compell them: His Majesty was incensed and perswaded (with his Army) to advance to <hi>Barwicke;</hi> but by Gods providence there was a pacification, and His Majestie returned home in peace, though quickly after he returned to that wicked counsell of Bishops, and Popish affected, (all promises buried in oblivion) was perswaded to raise another Army: New Proclamations and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was printed, full of bitternesse against the <hi>Scots:</hi> and a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment called to raise monies for that warre: the Parliament refusing, was presently dissolved: but the warre notwithstanding went forward: then the <hi>Scots</hi> (as we all know) entred <hi>Newcastle,</hi> standing upon their just defence.</p>
            <p>Then this Parliament was called to debate of the Warre, which tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Gods goodnesse they againe pacified to the great content of both Kingdomes; onely Bishops, Papists, and Popish affected, stormed at the peace, especially, that His Majesty had gratiously signed the Bill (b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cause of the many great affaires in hand) that this Parliament should not be broken without the consent of both Houses, and presently they plotted how to breake it.

                  </gap>rs</hi> axe tooke off this actor, as <hi>Feltons</hi> knife the other: then they laboured to hinder the proceedings in Parliament by their Votes (as wee are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Parliaments first Remonstrance) when Votes could no longer hinder, they bred devision in both Houses: and then between the King and both Houses, caused His Majestie to accuse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But indeede they thought to have put all in a present uproare, and so to have broke the Parliament: having during the time they were with the King in <hi>Scotland</hi> (as they hoped) made a partie there: and by the honours which they had perswaded the King to bestow upon some of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:125873:5"/> the Citizens, they thought they had blinded the City too: and then having actually raised that bloody Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> intending the same in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> they prevailed with His Majesty to come in hostile manner against his Parliament, to take thence by force those members before accused; having in a scroll divers others they likewise intended to accuse: so to have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Parliament, or forced it to their owne ends; which Gods providence and the Parliaments wisedome prevented.</p>
            <p>Then presently they endeavored to make themselves Masters and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of all the Armes and strong holds of the Kingdome: First, they bought out sir <hi>William Belford</hi> out of his place in the Tower, whom they knew to be uncorrupted and no instrument for their treason, and put Colonell <hi>Luns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> in his place; after him Sir <hi>Iohn Byrone,</hi> &amp; Captaine <hi>Leg</hi> to be governour of <hi>Hull,</hi> then the Earle of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> all very fit men to betray a Kingdome.</p>
            <p>These passages declare evidently their intention was to make warre against the Parliament and subjects. And hence it was that the Parliament desires to settle the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome in safe hands; and for this cause most Counties petitioned to have it so: So that the <hi>Militia</hi> was not the cause of their warre, but their preparation caused the <hi>Militia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They also made mutinies and tumults against the Citizens: First, <hi>Luns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> began in <hi>Westminster Hall,</hi> then others of that faction in <hi>Westminster,</hi> and after at <hi>Whitehall-gate</hi> and the <hi>Strand,</hi> cutting and slashing unarmed harmelesse Citizens: and then they perswaded they King from <hi>London,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending danger to his Majesties person by tumults, when indeede there was no tumults but what themselves caused.

            <p>But if that were the cause of their warre, they would not fight against the Parliament, f r all these the Parliament would have to bee established for ever: First, for his Majesties just rights and Prerogative they offer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme to Him and his posterity; yea more, to make him the happiest of all his Progenitors.</p>
            <p>And for the establishing the Protestant Religion, together with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the just and ancient priviledges of Parliament, and the knowne rights of the subject, it is all the Parliament desires of the King; that which they from the beginning (as still) doe humbly supplicate his Majesty for, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Innovations and Arbitrary Governement: therefore that can bee no ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se of their warre.</p>
            <p>Besides, I thinke no man needs information to assure him, that the cause why Popery is so farre broken in upon us, and so much innovation and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary governement as of late yeares, hath beene want of Parliaments, and would with greater violence breake in if this Parliament were not.</p>
            <p>Nor was it ever knowne, that any free elected Parliament of 500 or 600 Lords and Gentlemen of severall Counties and families, were the cause of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny innovation or arbitrary governement, nor is it likely can be; but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry have ever beene, and at this day are the security of this Kingdome against both: and therefore it is that this warre is made against this Parliament to destroy it, &amp; with it all other and to bring in an Arbitrary Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is true, particular men and private counsells may be corrupted to please Kings (in hope of present honours, and great estates) to betray a Kingdome, as private counsells at this day. And particular men, lately fled from this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to atchiefe their private ends, care not to destroy the priviliges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or to take away all Parliaments; (or which is worse) by the same Army they breake this, to force a pact Parliament of their owne choyce, and so make us slaves by act of Parliament, set up Popery by the Authority that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore it will be the wisedome of every man to make his eyes Judge in this cause rather than his eares; actions best shew the intentions; every tree is knowne by his fruit.</p>
            <p>At the entrance of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> to the Crowne, great protestations were made to maintaine the Protestant Religion, but we see her actions were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to it. The like Protestations we have heard concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> and great caling upon the Parlliament for assistance of that Kingdeme, but as often as preparations were made, all assistance and helpe was hindred, and the Rebells were from hence strengthened.</p>
            <p>Wee have heard severall Proclamations to put Lawes in execution against Papists: but wee see that the Parliament themselves were restrained, and might not execute the knowne lawes upon them, though they by humble pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions sought it, and now we see them in best esteeme, and most trusted.</p>
            <p>We have heard great promises that there was no intention to make warre against the Parliament, and seene it testified under many Lords hands (now in the Kings Army) onely a guard for the Kings person: but wee see a miserable and bloody warre to destroy the Parliament.</p>
            <p>We heard great protestations that no Papist should bee admitted into the Army: but we may see Papists swarme in that Army (yea in the Kings Court) like waspes about a honey pott, and in the North under the Command of the Earle of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> you may see 8000. professed Papists on a cluster.</p>
            <p>We heard heaven &amp; earth called to witnesse, that their warre was to defend Protestant Religion: but it were strange to see so many papists fight for it; but if it were so, why doe they set up publike Masse in <hi>Yorke</hi> and other places where that Army is? and imprison Protestant Ministers, and all others that doe but say they fight for the Protestant Religion? We have heard protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that priviledges of Parliament should be maintained, and the liberty of the subject, but if a Parliament may be broken by force, how can priviledges and liberties be preserved?</p>
            <p>You will say we have Trienniall Parliaments: I answer, that it is nothing, for the King is no more bound to be present at any Trienniall Parliament to confirme any Act (if it be called) than at this; besides the King is no more bound to call any Trienniall Parliament, than he is bound to preserve this.</p>
            <p>We have heard Proclamations prohibiting plundering by the Kings Army, and molesting his good subjects: but we see they doe plunder daily in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces except where they cannot overcome, or where nothing is to be had.</p>
            <p>We have heard of an acceptation of an accommodation, and seene it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by their owne faction: but we see them the next day come furiously and treacherously upon part of the Parliaments Army at <hi>Brainford,</hi> and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously

            <p>But the people of this kingdome ever have, and I hope ever will account Parliaments the fittest and best expounders of the Law, and judges of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, either to acquit or condemne them: they never wrest the Lawes for private ends, as other expounders (or rather forgetters) of law have lately done: when the subject (had lesse use of the law, and lesse liberty) were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned contrary to law, beyond the knowne power and rights of any King of <hi>England,</hi> their <hi>habeas corpusses</hi> and all baile denied them.</p>

Yet I am confident (and I think upon good ground) that the common prayer hath some needlesse things in it, and some offensiue, (as they may be in the worst sense interpreted: thus much for information of the present warre.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:125873:8"/>
            <p>Lastly, consider who, and what persons are the contrivers and actors in this warre: which are all of one of these sixe kinds.</p>
            <p>First, Jesuites and professed Papists.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Bishops and corrupt Clergy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Lords and Gentlemen, popishly affected.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Delinquents and Patentees.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, men of broken fortunes.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Atheists, and extreame deboyst men.</p>
            <p>And these all agree in one finall end <hi>(viz.)</hi> to betray Protestant Religion, Lawes, and the just Liberties of the Subject.</p>
            <p>But the three last sorts named, have each a particular end to themselves.</p>
            <p>The Delinquents aime is, their owne present preservation, to rescue their persons and estates from the justice of the Law, preferring themselves before Religion, Law, or posterity.</p>
            <p>Those of broken fortunes aime at pillage, to make themselves great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states out of the ruines of the Kingdome, which they cannot doe if Law bee not destroyed.</p>
            <p>The deboyst Atheists seeke to enjoy their licentious liberty, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre before Law or Religion. They hate the very name of reformation in others, yet these are the men that tell us they fight for the protestant Religion, priviledges of Parliament, and the subjects Liberty: But wee must beleeve that they have learned that damnable art of equivocation, or mentall reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Jesuites.</p>
            <p>That when they protest to fight for the Protestant Religion, priviledges of Parliament, and the subjects Liberty, their meaning is, that they fight for all these as ours, to take them from us as they doe our estates, or as a theefe fights for a true mans purse, and this is these mens warre.</p>
            <p>Now if we examine why the Parliament and Kingdome have raised an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and consider their forepast proceedings, their present actions, and the persons engaged in their warre, wee shall plainely see that they aime at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Gods glory, the safety of the Kings person and posterity, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the true Protestant Religion, Parliament priviledges, and the just Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the subject against those that (say they fight for them) and would take them from us: all which are at once assaulted by the severall armies of the Cavaliers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In their proceedings in this Parliament, consider the declined and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated condition of things in Church and State, as they found them when the Parliament began. And then take notice of their care and wisedome to make peace betweene the two Nations, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> His Majesty being then (by a Malignant counsell) engaged in a warre against his good subjects
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:125873:9"/> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which that Councell could not mannage for him, nor his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie desert with honour, they vindicated his Majesty, stayed bloodshed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled the Nations, satisfied the wronged <hi>Scots,</hi> payed the Kings Army, disbursed great summes out of their owne purses, and ingaged themselves for much more.</p>

            <p>You will say the King hath acknowledged that fault, and it is no more to

And whilest his Majestie still retaines such Counsellors, hee may still forget his promises. That which hath beene, may be againe.</p>
            <p>Who is that man for his owne particular, that would bee willing at the Kings request, to cancell all his evidences for his Lands and inheritance, and rest onely upon a bare word to posterities? much lesse a Parliament to trust all the rights and inheritance of a Kingdome, upon the bare word of a King, when guided by a Malignant Counsell, who seekes the Kingdomes ruine.</p>
            <p n="9">9.

            <p n="10">10. Their many Messages and Petitions to the King sent from place to place, till (at <hi>Yorke</hi>) their Messengers were beaten, Parliament men threatned; their houses beseiged, plundered, their friends abused and pillaged before the Parliament had any Army on foote, and after they had an Army they never struck before they were stricken: such was their backwardnesse to warre, else they might have easily fetch all that Malignant Counsell from <hi>Yorke</hi> and prevented all the mischiefe they have since made and done in the Kingdome; which if the Parliament had foreseene and prevented, men would not have beleeved what now they see, but would have blamed the Parliaments for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse more than now.</p>
            <p>That the Parliament have no end to themselves in this warre, but onely Gods glory and the publique good, is manifest in their contempt of dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable honours and corrupt dignities: doe but consider what some of them have lost, and what others of them might have if they were or would be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; some have lost the favour of their King, and the highest pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To all the former, adde this; that (after their offers, petitions, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:125873:10"/> formerly for peace were all rejected) they, at the request and humble petitions of many of us in the City of <hi>London</hi> and other Counties, willingly offered againe new propositions more low than the former, accompanied with the humble Petition of both Houses to be accepted, a manifest testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their desires of peace, and unwillingnesse to warre, if necessity constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not.</p>
            <p>In the second place, consider their present actions in the managing of this their defensive warre, having no other choyse but two extreames, either to fight or lose all, all being challenged, and at once assaulted by menacing armies.</p>
            <p>Now we know that nature hath taught all creatures to defend their lives, but nature, law, and Religion teach and allow men to defend themselves from unjust violence, the law of the Kingdome allowes a man to kill rather then to be killed; and Religion restrained not that Kingly Prophet <hi>David</hi> to take Armes in defence of his life against <hi>Saul</hi> his King: if <hi>David</hi> might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himselfe against <hi>Saul,</hi> then much more against <hi>Sauls</hi> evill Counsellors.</p>
            <p>But it is objected, that <hi>David</hi> would not lay his hand upon <hi>Saul</hi> (the Lords anoynted) when hee had twice opportunity put into his hands. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi> It is true <hi>David</hi> would not, nor might not kill <hi>Saul</hi> in a treacherous manner; But if <hi>Saul</hi> would wilfully thrust himselfe into battell against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>David</hi> and perish, <hi>David</hi> would have beene guiltlesse, as appeareth 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.9, 10. <hi>David</hi> tooke Armes in his owne defence: The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Kingdome in defence of their Religion and Hereditary rights, not onely so, but to defend the Kings person, and to rescue him from the hands of cursed Dam-my Rammy Cavaliers: Therefore scandalous are those mouthes that report the Parliament takes Armes against the King.</p>
            <p>Wee have made choice of the men, and have trusted them with all our rights: the King hath accepted of them, and acknowledged them his great Councell, and they according to their trust, defend our Rights and his person and posterity.</p>
            <p>They freely venture their lives and estates for us, and for our King against wicked Councellors, who seeke his Majesties ruine as well as ours; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are bound by conscience, law, and Religion to defend them: should we neglect them because they doe his Majesty and us right, or shall wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert them because they will not betray us. Though <hi>Saul</hi> had sworne that <hi>Ionathan</hi> should die, the people would rescue him, and said, <hi>Ionathan</hi> should not die. Much more would they have rescued <hi>Saul</hi> against wicked Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors that sought his ruine? our Parliament is not onely in danger, and with it, all that is ours: but the person of our Soveraigne Lord <hi>King Charles,</hi> by Jesuites and popish Traytors, who if they cannot poyson his soule, will poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:125873:10"/> stab, or destroy his body? we cannot thinke they will deale better with him than they did with <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> whom they slew; the one, because hee would not suffer them to sway the Scepter; the other, because he refused to breake his Covenants with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Princes.

            <p>Thirdly, consider the persons ingaged in this defensive warre, and it will appeare, that they are all his Majesties best and most faithfull subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

There was one <hi>Iudas</hi> amongst Christs twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and one <hi>Achon</hi> in the Campe of God. I pray God to purge such out of his and our Armies.</p>
            <p>Now having informed you of the Kingdomes danger, and the justnesse of the Kingdomes defensive warre; for the Parliaments Army is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, for God, the King, and the Kingdome, the other is the Cavaleers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

Be therefore exhorted to be corragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this cause, for God, the King, and your posterity; wisemen forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, will be forearmed; if through our credulity to deceivers we suffer our selves to be destroyed, or if wee beleeve our danger and doe nothing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, our misery will be the greater, and we most miserable under it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what <hi>Mordecai</hi> in such a case said to <hi>Ester,</hi> and the same I say to thee: If thou helpe not at this time according to thy ability, place, and degree, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance shall arise some other way, but thou shalt perish. Destructive war is now in the land, such a war as is against God, therefore sit not still and say with thy selfe, let others fight, give, pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thinke to bee safe thy selfe, like <hi>Gilead, Dan,</hi> and <hi>Asher,</hi> and all reproved; But <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Nephtali</hi> are commended, who jeoparded their lives in the fields against the enemy: In the meane time <hi>Meroz</hi> a people able to helpe, and neere at hand stood neuters: but <hi>Meroz</hi> is therefore cursed, and that bitterly, because the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants came not to the helpe of the Lord and his people. Therefore all that are Gods people, or looke to have part in Christ, will now come forth to the helpe of the Lord against <hi>Baal.</hi> Halt not between two opinions. If thou be a Protestant, defend thy Religion against them that say they are Protestants, but are not. If thou be a Papist, why dost thou dissemble; professe ot bee what thou art, &amp; be what thou professest: A profest Papist is in a better condition, &amp; more to be trusted then a lukewarm Neuter. There is but one God, on truth, &amp; one faith, in which men can be saved: The Parliament professe that one God truth, and true faith of Jesus Christ; and that they and all Gods elect (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept such as are yet ignorant) defend, the other Army say the like, (but tis to deceive us,) and say they take Armes to defend that which none oppose but themselves: They make Protestation and urge it upon men by force, wherein they call God to witnesse, and so doe wee. But they have now brought the controversie to a desired Issue, for surely the Judge of all the world will doe right, and though hee now afflict his people, and for a time suspend sentence, it will be alwaies so. But he will not shew wonders in the world, and declare to the eyes of men who speake the truth, and who dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; a considerate man may see the Parliaments reality, and the others dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, by the mercies of the one even to their professed enemies, and the barbarous cruelty of the other, not only to us, but to their owne friends, spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; plundering all, one as well as another, witnesse <hi>Banbury, Brainford, Reading, Newbery</hi> &amp; all Townes &amp; places where by force or fraud, they have entered, which the Parliament forces have not done in any Towne or place
